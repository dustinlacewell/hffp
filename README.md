# Problems from Haskell From First Principles

Here are some solutions I managed to complete from the book:

https://haskellbook.com/

Use the `test.sh` command to doctest the solutions.

    # test all solutions
    ./test.sh
    # test all solutions in chapter 11
    ./test.sh 11
    # test a specific solution
    ./test.sh 11/vigenere-cipher.hs

Use `-v` for verbose output

Use `-w` to watch a test
